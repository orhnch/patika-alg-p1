## Q1

[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort

Steps of Solution

    [22,27,16,2,18,6]

    [2,27,16,22,18,6]
    [2,6,16,22,18,27]
    [2,6,16,22,18,27]
    [2,6,16,18,22,27]

Big O Notation

    n + n-1 + n-2 + ... + 1
    n(n+1) / 2
    n^2 + n / 2
    
    So,
    Big O: O(n^2)

Time Comptlexity:

    Average case: O(n^2) 
    Worst case: O(n^2)
    Best case: O(n^2)

After the list sorted 18 is best case
